## Setup

<a name="cloning"></a>

### Cloning the project

1. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/) if you haven't already.
1. Change to the directory where you want to keep these files.
1. `git clone https://github.com/gadicc/node-yahoo-finance2.git`
1. `cd node-yahoo-finance2`

**Default branch: devel**

All PRs should be submitted against the `devel` branch (github default).

<a name="tools"></a>

### Required Tools: Deno & editor plugins

We use the [deno](https://deno.com/) runtime for development. It can be
installed with a single command and replaces node, npm, eslint, prettier, tsc;
is super fast and relieves us of many pain points. The library is still
published in npm and runs on node and other runtimes.

**vscode:** Make sure you have the official
[Deno extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno)
installed. This includes the language server for super fast typescript, linting,
formatting, etc, and will use the project settings in `.vscode/settings.json`.

<a name="nb"></a>

## Import things to know

<a name="schema"></a>

### Schema Generation

To deliver a type-safe experience, we need to validate all input to ensure it
conforms to what we expect. The single source of truth are the **typescript
interfaces** in each module file. These are compiled into JSON schemas which are
then used for runtime validation.

In VSCode, this is done for you automatically. Otherwise, run `deno task schema`
after changing a file, or `deno task schema --watch` to recompile after file
changes. This only affects `.ts` files that contain a `@yf-schema` keyword.

<a name="testing"></a>

### Testing

`deno task test`

NB: HTTP requests are cached to disk. This ensures we can run all tests quickly
and consistently across repos. Guidance on how to retrieve fresh data will
follow, in the meantime, just delete the relevant file in `tests/fixtures/http`.
We use the [fetch-mock-cache](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fetch-mock-cache)
library for this.

Set the environment variable `FETCH_DEVEL=nocache` to force run all network
tests without the cache. Set `FETCH_DEVEL=recache` to do the same, but also
rewrite the cache for any failing tests. In both cases, skipped for ids ending
`.static` or `.fake`, which are fixtures we never want to update because they
rely on time-sensitive data or made up data, respectively. Most of this code
lives in [tests/common.ts](./tests/common.ts).

<a name="linting"></a>

### Linting, formatting

Done automatically for you in VSCode with the official Deno extension. If you
use a different editor, please `deno lint` and `deno fmt` before submitting pull
requests.

<a name="docs"></a>

### Documentation

We have two kinds of docs. The [explainer docs](./docs/) and
[API docs](https://jsr.io/@gadicc/yahoo-finance2/doc). The latter are generated
automatically on publish. However, you can build them locally too if you want to
check their appearance before commit. `deno task docs:gen` will build the docs
to a directory called `jsdocs`; `deno task docs:watch` will rebuild the docs on
file changes (just make sure to reload the commmand if you change the deno.json
`exports`), and `deno task docs:open` will open your browser to the docs on
POSIX compliant systems.

<a name="commits"></a>

### Commiting Changes

**Commit Messages**

Commit messages should follow the
[conventionalcommits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard (basically
Angular). This is important as we use
[semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to
automate releases and [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) entries when we merge back to
master.

<a name="other"></a>

### Other

We're still writing these docs ahead of the official v3 release. Let us know if
you need help, or if anything could have been explained better.

### Fixing a bug

It's greatly appreciated when bug fix include a test that fails without your fix
and passes with it :pray:

TODO

### Adding a new module

Checklist:

1. Create it in `src/modules/myAmazingModule.ts`
1. Run `yarn generateSchema` (and on any future interface changes)
1. Test it in `src/modules/myAmazingModule.spec.ts`
1. Add it to `src/index-common.ts`
1. Docs in `docs/modules/myAmazingModule.md`
1. Link these docs in `README.md` and `docs/README.md`.
1. Commit all the above and any `tests/http/*` created in your tests.

For a model example, see the
[recommendationsBySymbol PR](https://github.com/gadicc/node-yahoo-finance2/pull/28)
by [@pudgereyem](https://github.com/pudgereyem). However, always base your work
on the most current code.

Things to be aware of:

1. Some Yahoo results vary by time, e.g. when particular markets are open,
   closed, in pre-trading etc. It may help to run your validation tests with
   `FETCH_DEVEL=nocache` (see [Devel Mode](#devel-mode), above) at different
   times of the day to make sure you've covered all cases. If you find something
   that doesn't pass, please add another permanent/cached test for it in the
   spec file.
